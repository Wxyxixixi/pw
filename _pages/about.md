G'Day! I'm a second year PhD student at ANU, supervised by [Prof.Hongdong Li](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/), and have [A/Prof.Mehrtash Harandi](https://sites.google.com/site/mehrtashharandi/) and [Prof.Richard Hartley](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=cHia5p0AAAAJ&hl=en) as my advisors. My research interests are in **3D Vision** and **Generative Modeling**. 
 Currently I'm diving into **Direct 3D Generation**,**3D Content Generation**, **Computer Graphics** and **Geometric Deep Learning**.

Previously, I graduated with Master's Degree in Machine Learning and Computer Vision from The Australian National University, advised by [Prof. Nick Barnes](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~nmb/) and [Dr. Jing Zhang](https://jingzhang617.github.io/) in Generative Modelling. During my master study, I had the opportunity to take intern in Tencent XR Labs, working with [Dr. Xiu Li](https://lixiulive.com/) and [Dr. Shihao Jiang](https://zacjiang.github.io/) for VR Human Motion Reconstruction. I have also interned at Baidu as a interned engineer for 3D point cloud tracking. I have been intrigued by computer vision, 3D Geometic and generative modelling, their research problems also shed light to my now and the near future :D. Further back, I obtained the Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from USYD and HIT.
