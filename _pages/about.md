G'Day! I'm an incoming PhD student at ANU in 2024 Janurary, supervised by [Prof.Hongdong Li](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/). My research interest is in Computer Vision and Machine Learing.

Previously, I obtained my Master degree in Machine Learning and Computer Vision from Australian National University in 2023. I had been luckily worked with [Prof. Nick Barnes](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~nmb/) and [Dr. Jing Zhang](https://jingzhang617.github.io/), gaining invaluable knowledge in Generative Models.  I also have the previllege to work closely with [Dr.Shihao Jiang](https://zacjiang.github.io/) and [Dr.Xiu Li](https://lixiulive.com/) during my internship at Tencent XR Lab, gaining hands on experience in 3D Human.

Dating back, I have obtained my B.Eng degree in EE in 2020, from [Harbin Institude of Technology](http://hitee.hit.edu.cn/) , China, and B.Eng degree from [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-electrical-and-information-engineering.html) , Australia, as a [joint bachelor program](https://www.crs.jsj.edu.cn/aproval/detail/436). I always amazed about the variousity and commonality across different cultures as well as learning different subjects.

In my spare time, I often go dancing :dancer:, exploring the expressiveness of my limbs and the musicality of my dancing expression. Meanwhile, I also enjoyed all kinds of outdoor sports :climbing_woman::tennis:	:swimmer:. Currently, hitting a goal for a half-marathon in 2024 is what I'm focused after the work :running_woman:.
