G'Day! I'm a first year PhD student at ANU, supervised by [Prof.Hongdong Li](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/), and have [A/Prof.Mehrtash Harandi](https://sites.google.com/site/mehrtashharandi/) and [Prof.Richard Hartley](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=cHia5p0AAAAJ&hl=en) as my advisors. My research interests are in **3D Vision** and **Generative Modeling**. 
 Currently I'm diving into **3D Content Generation**, **Computer Graphics** and **Geometric Deep Learning**.

Previously, I graduated with Master's Degree in Machine Learning and Computer Vision from The Australian National University, and work closely with [Prof. Nick Barnes](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~nmb/), [Dr. Jing Zhang](https://jingzhang617.github.io/),[Dr. Shihao Jiang](https://zacjiang.github.io/) and [Dr. Xiu Li](https://lixiulive.com/) in the **3D Human Motion Reconstruction**.

Dating back, I obtained my B.Eng in Electrical Engineering from The University of Sydney, Australia, and received the Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from the Harbin Institute of Technology, China, as a joint bachelor program in 2020. My bachelor's thesis is about ''Signal Processing with Deep Learning Methods''. I always amazed about the variousity and commonality across different cultures as well as learning different subjects.

In my spare time, I often go dancing :dancer:, exploring the expressiveness of my limbs and the musicality of my dancing expression. Meanwhile, I also enjoyed all kinds of outdoor sports :climbing_woman::tennis:	:swimmer:. ~~Currently, finish a half-marathon in 2024 is my goal off ofice~~ (Updates: Finished the 2024 Canberra Half Marathon on April 7th 2024! ) :running_woman:.
