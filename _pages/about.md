G'Day! I'm a first year PhD student at ANU, advised by [Prof.Hongdong Li](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/). My research topics is in **3D Vision**. 
 Including but not limited to **3D Mesh Processing**, **Geometric Deep Learning** and **3D Human Motion Reconstruction**.

Previously, I graduated with Master's Degree in Machine Learning and Computer Vision from The Australian National University, and work closely with [Prof. Nick Barnes](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~nmb/), [Dr. Jing Zhang](https://jingzhang617.github.io/),[Dr.Shihao Jiang](https://zacjiang.github.io/) and [Dr.Xiu Li](https://lixiulive.com/) in the intersection of Generative Models and Human Motion.

Dating back, I obtained my B.Eng in Electrical Engineering from The University of Sydney, Australia, in 2020, and simultaneously received the Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from the Harbin Institute of Technology, China. I always amazed about the variousity and commonality across different cultures as well as learning different subjects.

In my spare time, I often go dancing :dancer:, exploring the expressiveness of my limbs and the musicality of my dancing expression. Meanwhile, I also enjoyed all kinds of outdoor sports :climbing_woman::tennis:	:swimmer:. ~~Currently, finish a half-marathon in 2024 is my goal off ofice~~ (Updates: Finished the 2024 Canberra Half Marathon on April 7th 2024! ) :running_woman:.
